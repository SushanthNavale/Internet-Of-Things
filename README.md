Garbage Monitoring System
This project was mainly implemented to overcome the present garbage collection system implemneted by the goverment.
Here we are using three main sensors:
1.Ultrasonic Sensor : mainly for dry wasste, through which we use the range properties to detect if the bin is full or half filled or empty 
and we will be indicating it with LED for empty, half filled and full.
2.load cell: mainly for wet waste, which will be calculated with the weight if full the led will indicate that bin is totally filled.
3.Smoke Sensor: To detect if dry waste catches fire, if it will b indicated with a buzzer.
4.nrf24l01: to communicate with browser and send data.
